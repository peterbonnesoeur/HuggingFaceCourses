# Hugging Face Course

Course provided by HuggingFace providing the latest achievements in NLP and pipeline integration.

The course can be found on the [HuggingFace Website](https://huggingface.co/course) and also countains more theoretical sections that NEEDS to be studied. This repo being only the locally run experiments from the course.

Personnal note: highly recommended even for a skilled NLP engineer/scientist as those models are encapsulated to tackle deployment and continuous integration in various projects.

Installation:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

P.S: the usage of a virtualenv is highly recommended as the modesl used by Hugging Face are fairly bit (~GB).
