# Hugging Face Course

Course provided by HuggingFace providing the latest achievements in NLP andpipeline integration.

Personnal note: highly recommended even for a skilled NLP engineer/scientist as those models are encapsulated to tackle deployment and continuous integration in various projects.

Installation:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

P.S: the usage of a virtualenv is highly recommended as the modesl used by Hugging Face are fairly bit (~GB).
