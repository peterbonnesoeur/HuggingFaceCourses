This will allow us to use the option batched=True in our call to map, which will greatly speed up the tokenization.

    "In PyTorch, the function that is responsible for putting together samples inside a batch is called a collate function. Itâ€™s an argument you can pass when you build a DataLoader, the default being a function that will just convert your samples to PyTorch tensors and concatenate them (recursively if your elements are lists, tuples, or dictionaries). This wonâ€™t be possible in our case since the inputs we have wonâ€™t all be of the same size. We have deliberately postponed the padding, to only apply it as necessary on each batch and avoid having over-long inputs with a lot of padding. This will speed up training by quite a bit, but note that if youâ€™re training on a TPU it can cause problems â€” TPUs prefer fixed shapes, even when that requires extra padding.\n",
